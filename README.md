# Hg42TabCorner

A theme based on the idea of (BeOS / Haiku?) xfwm4 standard theme called B6
(at least on Debian, install xfwm4-themes)

allows "tab" like title bars at the top and also on the left.

features/considerations:

* the application icon (also menu) stands out on top left, so it is visible
  so you also see on the left to which application the tab belongs

* everything necessary is at the top left

  * a bar space below the application icon allows

    * clicking on it to rise the window
      (the icon opens the menu, which is inconvenient for rising)

    * dragging to size the window (as it's part of the corner)

  * the buttons are placed in front of the title

* the frame is thick enough to allow easy grabbing on large screens (like 43").
